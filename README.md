The abbreviation LCM stands for "Least Common Multiple." The 
smallest multiple that two or more numbers share is known as the least 
common multiple.
For example: Take two integers, 2 and 3.
Multiples of TWO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20….
Multiples of THREE: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ….
The typical multiples of 2 and 3 are 6, 12, and 18. The lowest number is 
6. As a result, the least frequent multiple of 2 and 3 is 6.
The least number that both numbers may divide by is known as the 
LCM of two numbers.
Finding the lowest common denominator (LCD) between two or more 
fractions is one of the most popular uses of LCM. It is important for 
adding, taking away from, and contrasting two or more fractions.
